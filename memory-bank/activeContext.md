# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Core TODO functionality completed! Validation logic implemented (Task 2.6 done). Responsive styling (Task 9) is mostly done. Next: persistence (Task 2.3) and final testing (Task 10).
**Recent Changes:**
- âœ… Task 1: Project Setup and Configuration - COMPLETED
- âœ… Task 3: Create Navigation and Page Layout - COMPLETED 
- âœ… Task 8: Create Home and About Pages - COMPLETED
- âœ… Task 4: Create TODO Input Component - COMPLETED (including subtask 4.4: Input Validation and Accessibility Features)
- âœ… Task 5: Implement TODO List Component - COMPLETED
- âœ… Task 7: Implement TODO Page - COMPLETED
- âœ… Subtask 2.1: Design GlobalState Structure for Todo Management - COMPLETED
- âœ… Subtask 2.2: Implement CRUD Operations for Todo Items - COMPLETED
- âœ… Subtask 2.6: Implement Validation Logic for Todo Data - COMPLETED
- âœ… **Task 9: Implement Responsive Styling - MOSTLY COMPLETED** (subtasks 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5 done)
- ðŸ”„ Task 2: Implement GlobalState for TODO Items - IN PROGRESS (3/6 subtasks done)
- ðŸ“‹ **MAJOR UPDATE:** Expanded all tasks with detailed subtasks based on AI complexity analysis
- Enhanced CRUD operations in GlobalState.jsx with pure function principles:
  - addTodo() and editTodo() now include validation via validateTodoText()
  - validateTodoText() checks type, length (1â€“100), and allowed characters
  - invalid input is rejected with console warning
- Conducted task complexity analysis showing high complexity tasks: Task 2 (7), Task 6 (6), Task 9 (6), Task 10 (8)
- Reorganized task completion based on actual progress vs planned dependencies
- **Fixed routing issue:** Application now navigates correctly between pages.
- **Fixed "Add Task" button:** Functionality is now working as expected.

**Next Steps:**
- **PRIORITY 1:** Complete Task 2: GlobalState enhancements (3 remaining subtasks: persistence, error handling, testing)
- **PRIORITY 2:** Complete Task 9: Implement Responsive Styling (1 remaining subtask: Accessibility Compliance and WCAG Guidelines)
- **PRIORITY 3:** Task 10: Final Testing and Optimization (8 subtasks, highest complexity score 8/10)
- **OPTIONAL:** Task 6: Create separate TODO Item Component (6 subtasks, current functionality integrated in TodoList works well)
- **NEW TASK STRUCTURE:** 46 total subtasks (21 completed, 25 pending) across 10 main tasks
- **COMPLEXITY-BASED PLANNING:** All tasks now have detailed subtasks based on AI complexity analysis recommendations

**Active Decisions:**
- Using Vite over Create React App for better performance and modern tooling
- JavaScript over TypeScript for simplicity per project requirements
- React Router for client-side navigation between pages
- Custom GlobalState implementation as specified in requirements
- Organized folder structure: components, pages, context, hooks
- **Adopted a more robust GlobalState update pattern** by passing `setGlobalState` to helper functions.

**Important Patterns:**
- Following Task Master development workflow with granular progress tracking
- Step-by-step implementation approach with verification at each stage
- Hot module replacement provides immediate feedback on changes
- Memory bank documentation keeps context across sessions

**Learnings:**
- Vite development server provides excellent performance and fast hot-reloading
- React Router v6 syntax with element prop instead of component prop
- GlobalState context pattern working correctly with todos array
- Validation logic improves data integrity and user experience
- Project structure is well-organized and scalable for future features
- **Debugging routing issues requires careful inspection of component rendering and event handling.**
- **Directly passing `setGlobalState` to helper functions is a more reliable pattern for updating global state from non-hook functions.**
