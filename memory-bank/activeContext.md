# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Initial project setup and task planning.
**Recent Changes:**
- Initial memory bank files created/confirmed.
- Task complexity analysis performed using Task Master.
- Complex tasks expanded into subtasks based on the complexity report.
- Individual task files generated/updated in the `tasks/` directory.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin implementing the tasks, following the order defined by dependencies and priority.
- Start with the first available task (likely Task 1: Project Setup and Configuration).
- Continuously update task statuses in Task Master as work progresses.
- Log implementation details and learnings in the subtask details using `update_subtask`.

**Active Decisions:**
- Using Task Master for project management and task tracking.
- Utilizing AI for task complexity analysis and breakdown.

**Important Patterns:**
- Following the Task Master development workflow.
- Documenting progress and decisions in the memory bank.

**Learnings:**
- Encountered and addressed an issue with Task Master API key configuration (though the user's specific setup outside of Cursor still needs clarification).
