- ðŸ”„ **Task 2: Implement GlobalState for TODO Items - IN PROGRESS (3/6 subtasks done)**
- React application successfully created using Vite with JavaScript template.
- Development environment is fully functional with server running on http://localhost:5173/.
- Complete project structure with organized folders and multi-page routing functional.
- GlobalState implementation with comprehensive CRUD operations:
  - addTodo() - creates todos with timestamps and proper structure
  - toggleTodo() - handles completion status changes
  - deleteTodo() - removes todos by id
  - editTodo() - updates todo text with timestamps
  - getTodos() & getTodo() - data retrieval functions
- Navigation component with working React Router links between pages.
- App.jsx properly configured with Router and GlobalStateProvider.
- Hot module replacement working correctly with Vite.
- **Complexity Analysis Completed** - identified high complexity tasks (Task 2: 7, Task 6: 6, Task 9: 6, Task 10: 8).
- Task Master workflow proves effective for granular progress tracking and project management.
- **Routing issue fixed:** Application now navigates correctly between pages.
- **"Add Task" button fixed:** Functionality is now working as expected.

**What's Left to Build:**
- âœ… **CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETED:** All major TODO features implemented and tested:
  - âœ… GlobalState logic for TODO items (CRUD operations) - WORKING
  - âœ… UI components (TodoInput, TodoList, Navigation, Pages) - WORKING  
  - âœ… Multi-page routing - WORKING
  - âœ… Full TODO functionality: add, edit, toggle completion, delete - TESTED
- **ðŸ“‹ EXPANDED TASK BREAKDOWN (based on AI complexity analysis):**
  - **46 total subtasks** across 10 main tasks
  - **26 subtasks completed** (56.5% progress)
  - **20 subtasks pending** with detailed implementation plans
  - **7 new subtasks added:** focusing on accessibility, performance, validation, deployment
- **Remaining high-priority work:**
  - **Task 2:** GlobalState enhancements (3 remaining subtasks: persistence, error handling, testing)
  - **Task 9:** Responsive styling (1 remaining subtask: Accessibility Compliance and WCAG Guidelines)
  - **Task 10:** Comprehensive testing and optimization (8 subtasks) - highest complexity
  - **Task 6:** Separate TODO Item Component (6 subtasks) - optional, current integration works well

**Current Status:** Core TODO functionality is complete and fully working! Detailed task breakdown complete based on complexity analysis. Ready for responsive styling and accessibility enhancements phase.

**Known Issues:**
- An issue with Task Master API key configuration was encountered and resolved by clarifying the expected location of the key (in `.env` or `.cursor/mcp.json` depending on the Task Master setup). Further clarification on the user's specific Task Master execution method might be beneficial if issues persist.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Decision to use Task Master for task management and leverage its AI features for task analysis and breakdown has been successfully implemented.
- Adopted a more robust GlobalState update pattern by passing `setGlobalState` to helper functions.
- Debugging routing issues required careful inspection of component rendering and event handling.
