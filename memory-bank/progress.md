# Progress

**What Works:**
- The basic project structure is set up.
- The core memory bank files are initialized and updated with initial project context.
- The initial project tasks have been defined based on the project brief.
- Task complexity analysis has been performed, identifying tasks that require further breakdown.
- Complex tasks have been expanded into detailed subtasks.
- Individual task files reflecting the subtasks have been generated.
- Task Master is set up for project management.

**What's Left to Build:**
- The entire TODO list application functionality and UI, as detailed in the expanded tasks and subtasks. This includes:
    - Implementing GlobalState logic for TODO items (CRUD operations).
    - Creating UI components (Input, List, Item, Navigation, Pages).
    - Implementing routing.
    - Applying responsive styling.
    - Final testing and optimization.

**Current Status:** Initial project setup and detailed task planning are complete. The project is ready for the implementation phase.

**Known Issues:**
- An issue with Task Master API key configuration was encountered and resolved by clarifying the expected location of the key (in `.env` or `.cursor/mcp.json` depending on the Task Master setup). Further clarification on the user's specific Task Master execution method might be beneficial if issues persist.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Decision to use Task Master for task management and leverage its AI features for task analysis and breakdown has been successfully implemented.
