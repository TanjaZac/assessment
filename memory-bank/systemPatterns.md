# System Patterns

**System Architecture:** A client-side single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.
**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Using Vite as the build tool and development server for faster development experience.
- Utilizing the provided custom `GlobalState` implementation for application-wide state management.
- JavaScript template chosen over TypeScript for simplicity per project requirements.
- Component-based architecture for building the UI.
- Client-side routing for navigation between pages.
- No backend persistence; data is stored in memory using `GlobalState`.

**Design Patterns:**
- **Component Pattern:** Breaking down the UI into reusable React components (e.g., TODO Input, TODO List, TODO Item, Navigation, Pages).
- **Global State Pattern:** Centralized state management using the custom `GlobalState` context and hook.
- **Container/Presentational Pattern (Implicit):** Pages act as containers fetching data from GlobalState and passing it to presentational components.

**Component Relationships:**
- `App` component serves as the root.
- `GlobalStateProvider` wraps the application to provide state context.
- Navigation component handles routing.
- Page components (TODO Page, Home, About) are rendered based on the route.
- TODO Page composes `TODO Input`, `TODO List`.
- `TODO List` renders multiple `TODO Item` components.

**Critical Implementation Paths:**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** CRUD operations for TODO items within the `GlobalState` - fully functional
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** UI components connected to `GlobalState` for displaying and modifying TODO data
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** User interactions (add, edit, delete, toggle complete) and `GlobalState` updates working
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS:** Enhanced error handling, persistence, and validation for `GlobalState`
- ‚è≥ **NEXT:** Responsive design implementation to ensure usability across devices
- ‚è≥ **FUTURE:** Comprehensive testing, accessibility compliance, and production optimization

**New Architecture Insights (Post-Implementation):**
- **TodoList Component Integration:** Successfully integrated all TODO item functionality (display, edit, delete, toggle) directly within TodoList component rather than separate TodoItem component - proves to be efficient and maintainable
- **Inline Editing Pattern:** Implemented conditional rendering for edit mode within list items - provides seamless UX
- **State Management Success:** Custom GlobalState implementation works excellently with React hooks pattern
- **Component Composition:** TodoPage successfully composes TodoInput + TodoList components with clean separation of concerns
