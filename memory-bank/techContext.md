# Tech Context

**Technologies Used:**
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JavaScript: Programming language.
- Custom GlobalState implementation: Provided proof-of-concept for state management.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring content.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the UI.
- (Potentially) A component library like Material-UI (decision pending based on design phase).

**Development Setup:**
- Standard Node.js and npm/yarn environment.
- React development server for local development.
- Code editor (VS Code recommended).
- Task Master for task management.

**Technical Constraints:**
- No data persistence after page refresh (data stored in memory).
- Must use the provided custom GlobalState implementation.

**Dependencies:**
- `react`
- `react-dom`
- (Potentially) A component library (e.g., `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled` for Material-UI).
- Task Master (installed globally or via npx).

**Tool Usage Patterns:**
- Using Task Master CLI/MCP tools for managing tasks (list, next, show, set-status, expand, analyze-complexity, generate).
- Utilizing AI features in Task Master for task breakdown and analysis.
- Using standard development tools (terminal, code editor, browser).
