# Tech Context

**Technologies Used:**
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JavaScript: Programming language.
- Custom GlobalState implementation: Provided proof-of-concept for state management.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring content.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the UI.
- (Potentially) A component library like Material-UI (decision pending based on design phase).

**Development Setup:**
- Vite-based React development environment with JavaScript template.
- Development server running on http://localhost:5173/.
- Node.js and npm environment successfully configured.
- Code editor (VS Code recommended).
- Task Master for task management and progress tracking.

**Technical Constraints:**
- No data persistence after page refresh (data stored in memory).
- Must use the provided custom GlobalState implementation.

**Dependencies:**
- `react` - UI library ✅ WORKING
- `react-dom` - DOM rendering ✅ WORKING  
- `react-router-dom` - Client-side routing ✅ WORKING
- `vite` - Build tool and dev server ✅ WORKING
- Task Master (MCP server integration) - Project management ✅ WORKING

**Future Dependencies (based on expanded subtasks):**
- Accessibility testing tools (`axe-core`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`)
- Performance monitoring tools
- CSS framework or component library (optional Material-UI)
- Testing utilities for comprehensive test suite

**Tool Usage Patterns:**
- **Task Master MCP Integration:** Using MCP server tools for comprehensive task management (get_tasks, set_task_status, add_subtask, expand_task, analyze_project_complexity)
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leveraging Task Master's complexity analysis for informed task breakdown (resulted in 46 detailed subtasks)
- **Development Workflow:** Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173/ with hot reload
- **Memory Bank Workflow:** Systematic documentation updates across sessions for context preservation
- **Browser Testing:** Live testing of TODO functionality in development environment
