      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Project Setup and Configuration task into subtasks covering environment setup, dependency installation, project structure creation, and initial configuration of routing and GlobalState.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard React project setup with some specific structure requirements. While not highly complex, it requires careful attention to detail for proper initialization of the project foundation."

      "taskTitle": "Implement GlobalState for TODO Items",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the GlobalState implementation task into subtasks covering state structure design, CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), state persistence, error handling, and unit testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires understanding the existing GlobalState implementation and extending it with todo-specific functionality. It involves state management patterns and multiple helper functions that need to work together correctly."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Navigation and Page Layout",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Navigation and Page Layout task into subtasks for creating the navigation component, implementing responsive layout structure, setting up routing configuration, and creating placeholder page components.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing routing and navigation which has moderate complexity. It requires creating multiple components that work together and setting up the overall application structure."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create TODO Input Component",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the TODO Input Component task into subtasks for form structure creation, form state management, and integration with GlobalState.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward form component with basic state management. The complexity is low as it only requires handling input state and form submission with validation."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement TODO List Component",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the TODO List Component task into subtasks for list rendering logic, empty state handling, and integration with GlobalState for data retrieval.",
      "reasoning": "This component requires mapping through todo items and handling conditional rendering. It has moderate complexity due to its integration with GlobalState and dependency on the TodoItem component."
    },

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Create TODO Item Component",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the TODO Item Component task into subtasks for basic item display, toggle completion functionality, delete functionality, edit mode UI, and edit save/cancel functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This component has significant complexity with multiple interactive features including toggling completion, inline editing with cancel/save options, and deletion. It requires careful state management for the editing mode."

      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the TODO Page task into subtasks for page layout structure and component integration.",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a composition task that combines previously created components. The complexity is low as it mainly involves arranging components rather than implementing new functionality."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create Home and About Pages",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Home and About Pages task into subtasks for creating each static page with appropriate content and styling.",
      "reasoning": "These are simple static pages with minimal functionality. They only require basic HTML structure and content placement with no complex logic or state management."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Styling",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Responsive Styling task into subtasks for base styles, navigation styles, form component styles, list component styles, and responsive media queries.",
      "reasoning": "Styling requires attention to detail across multiple components and ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes. The complexity comes from the need to maintain visual consistency while handling various UI states."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Final Testing and Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Final Testing and Optimization task into subtasks for functional testing, responsive design testing, performance optimization, memory leak checking, cross-browser compatibility testing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions and performance optimization. It requires a systematic approach to identify and fix issues across the entire application, making it one of the most complex tasks."
