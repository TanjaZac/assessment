      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the GlobalState implementation into: state structure design, CRUD operations implementation, persistence layer, error handling, validation logic, and comprehensive testing with performance considerations.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to state management architecture, multiple helper functions, data persistence requirements, and the need for robust error handling. Current subtasks are well-structured but could benefit from additional validation and performance optimization subtasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: form structure creation, input validation implementation, state management setup, and GlobalState integration with proper error handling and accessibility features.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving form handling, validation, and state integration. Current subtasks cover the basics but could include validation, accessibility, and user experience enhancements."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into: data rendering logic, empty state handling, GlobalState integration, and performance optimization with virtualization for large lists.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity due to data rendering, state management integration, and user interaction handling. Current subtasks are appropriate but could include performance considerations for large datasets."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: basic display implementation, toggle functionality, delete operations, edit mode UI, save/cancel logic, and accessibility features with keyboard navigation support.",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity due to multiple interaction modes (view/edit), state management, and user experience considerations. Current subtasks are well-defined but could include accessibility and keyboard navigation enhancements."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into: page layout structure, component integration, and state management coordination with proper error boundaries and loading states.",
      "reasoning": "Lower complexity as it primarily involves component composition and layout. Current subtasks are minimal but adequate. Could benefit from error boundary implementation and loading state management."
